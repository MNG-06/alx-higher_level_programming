Requirements
Python Scripts
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
C
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All your files should end with a new line
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded

Tasks

0. Print a list of integers

Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

Prototype: def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):
Format: one integer per line. See example
You are not allowed to import any module
You can assume that the list only contains integers
You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
You have to use str.format() to print integers

1. Secure access to an element in a list

Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

Prototype: def element_at(my_list, idx):
If idx is negative, the function should return None
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list), the function should return None
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
